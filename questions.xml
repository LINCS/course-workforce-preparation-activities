        <name>Question 1 of 5</name>
        <questiontext>&lt;p&gt;You have been asked to evaluate the curriculum for an ABE class to determine whether it effectively integrates the workforce preparation activities outlined in WIOA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of the following describe workforce preparation activities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="Prompt"&gt;Select all that apply.&lt;/p&gt;

        <questiontextformat>1</questiontextformat>
        <generalfeedback>&lt;p class="ScreenNumber"&gt;The correct answers are B, C, and D. Choices A and E describe occupational skills training. As discussed earlier, at their core, workforce preparation activities address general, transferable skills that cut across all industry sectors, technical occupations and career clusters (A is eliminated). While input from business and industry could be helpful to illustrate how workforce preparation skills are applied in the workplace, this sort of input is not required to teach general workforce preparation skills (E is eliminated). &lt;/p&gt;</generalfeedback>

        <questiontext>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"&gt;Read the following classroom activity description to identify the combination of workforce preparation activities that are the focus of the activity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"&gt;The teacher assists the class to generate a set of criteria for evaluating the validity of websites and content. He asks:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style="list-style-type: none;"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"&gt;How do you know that information you found on a website is valid and credible?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"&gt;What do you look for as clues?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"&gt;Entering key words for an occupation they are interested in, students choose three websites to evaluate against the validity criteria the class established earlier. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #693300; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"&gt;Select the combination of workforce preparation activities you feel best fits the scenario.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</questiontext>

        <generalfeedback>&lt;p class="Feedback"&gt;The correct answer is &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;, digital literacy and critical thinking. In reality, one could develop lessons and learning activities that touch on a combination of all or most of the workforce preparation activities, but here we’re highlighting the core activities that are directly addressed. Students are using digital literacy skill directly to research occupations and are using digital literacy and critical thinking skills to evaluate the validity of the information. While students are using information through this activity, it’s not apparent from the description that they are working together to research and evaluate the information.&lt;/p&gt;</generalfeedback>

        <questiontext>&lt;p&gt;Read the following classroom activity description to identify the combination of workforce preparation activities that are the focus of the activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The teacher facilitates a force-field analysis exercise. Students are asked to identify an educational goal that they’d like to meet in the next three to six months. Using a T chart, students list the factors (e.g., people, circumstances) that can support their progress towards the goal. Then they list the factors that may hinder their progress towards the goal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In pairs or small groups, students share their charts. They identify the two most commonly mentioned barriers and discuss possible solutions. Similarly, they discuss how they can make best use of their supports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="Prompt"&gt;Select the combination of workforce preparation activities you feel best fits the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;</questiontext>
        <questiontextformat>1</questiontextformat>
        <generalfeedback>&lt;p class="Feedback"&gt;The correct answer is &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;, self-management, utilizing resources, and critical thinking. In reality, one could develop lessons and learning activities that touch on a combination of all or most of the workforce preparation activities, but here we’re highlighting the core activities that are directly addressed. In this activity, self-management skills are addressed as students articulate a learning goal and reflect on their individual barriers and supports. They use a T chart to categorize and analyze their situational factors and discuss how they can use supports (resources).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="Feedback"&gt;The students are using critical thinking skills to categorize and analyze their barriers and supports, but there is no indication that digital literacy skills are practiced in this activity. While students are working with others, the activity doesn’t reference the application of specific academic skills.&lt;/p&gt;</generalfeedback>

In reality, one could develop lessons and learning activities that touch on a combination of all or most of the workforce preparation activities, but here we’re highlighting the core activities that are directly addressed. In this activity, self-management skills are addressed as students articulate a learning goal and reflect on their individual barriers and supports. They use a T chart to categorize and analyze their situational factors and discuss how they can use supports (resources).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="Feedback"&gt;The students are using critical thinking skills to categorize and analyze their barriers and supports, but there is no indication that digital literacy skills are practiced in this activity.

        <questiontext>&lt;p&gt;Read the following classroom activity description to identify the combination of workforce preparation activities that are the focus of the activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The teacher facilitates a discussion about the ways that appropriate communication norms vary depending on the setting and the context. In teams, students role-play scenarios that the teacher has developed. Each scenario takes place in a different setting: a workplace, a family party, and a supermarket. Students provide each other feedback on the role-play performances. Afterwards, the teacher facilitates a discussion on how the communication styles differ in each context and why.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              <feedback>&lt;p class="Feedback"&gt;The correct answer is &lt;strong&gt;C, critical thinking and problem solving&lt;/strong&gt;. All three resources refer explicitly to these skills. Although many of the skills might imply self-efficacy and self-advocacy, they are only mentioned explicitly as an essential competency in the Guide to ELA Classroom Activities. Only the NC-NET Resource Toolkit refers to entrepreneurship as one of its eight skills. &lt;/p&gt;</feedback>
